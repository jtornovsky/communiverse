# Exercise: Building a High-Scale Social Media Platform

## Objective
Build a high-scale social media platform that allows users to create profiles, make posts, comment on posts, and interact with other users. The platform should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent users and a high volume of data.

## Requirements

### User Management

- Users should be able to sign up, log in, and update their profiles.
- Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- Users should have profiles with basic information such as name, email, profile picture, etc.

### Post Management

- Users should be able to create posts with text, images, or videos.
- Posts should support likes, comments, and shares.
- Implement CRUD operations for posts.

### Comment Management

- Users should be able to comment on posts.
- Comments should support replies and threading.
- Implement CRUD operations for comments.

### Data Storage

- Use MongoDB to store user profiles, posts, comments, and other related data.
- Utilize Hibernate for mapping Java objects to MongoDB documents.

### High Scalability

- Utilize AWS services such as EC2 for hosting the application, RDS for database management, S3 for file storage, and Elasticache for Redis caching.
- Implement horizontal scaling using AWS autoscaling to handle varying levels of traffic.

### Caching

- Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed data such as user profiles, post lists, etc.
- Implement caching strategies to improve application performance and reduce database load.

### Real-time Updates

- Utilize Firebase Realtime Database for real-time synchronization of data such as comments or chat messages.
- Implement WebSocket or server-sent events (SSE) for real-time notifications of new posts, comments, etc.

### Integration and Deployment

- Integrate the backend application with AWS services as mentioned above.
- Deploy the frontend (if applicable) and static files on Firebase Hosting.
- Ensure seamless integration between different components of the system.

### Documentation and Testing

- Document the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details.
- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.

## Conclusion

This exercise challenges you to design and develop a high-scale social media platform using modern technologies such as Spring Boot, Hibernate, AWS, Redis, MongoDB, and Firebase. It provides hands-on experience in building complex distributed systems and addressing scalability, performance, and reliability concerns. Additionally, it allows you to explore various cloud services and databases commonly used in real-world applications.
